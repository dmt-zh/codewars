# A friend of mine takes the sequence of all numbers from 1 to n (where n > 0).
# Within that sequence, he chooses two numbers, a and b.
# He says that the product of a and b should be equal to the sum of all numbers in the sequence, 
# excluding a and b. Given a number n, could you tell me the numbers he excluded from the sequence?
# The function takes the parameter: n (n is always strictly greater than 0) and returns an array or 
# a string (depending on the language) of the form:
# [(a, b), ...] or [[a, b], ...] or {{a, b}, ...} or or [{a, b}, ...]
# with all (a, b) which are the possible removed numbers in the sequence 1 to n.
# [(a, b), ...] or [[a, b], ...] or {{a, b}, ...} or ... will be sorted in increasing order of the "a".
# It happens that there are several possible (a, b). The function returns an empty array
#  (or an empty string) if no possible numbers are found which will prove that my friend has not 
# told the truth! (Go: in this case return nil).
